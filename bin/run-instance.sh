# Starts your AWS instance, connects via SSH and launches Chrome with the remote Jupyter Notebook page open.
# Usage is as follows:
# 1. Run this script, so that Chrome has launched and SSH connection is established.
# 2. Execute 'jupyter notebook' on the AWS instance.
# 3. Reload the page in Chrome and log in to Jupyter Notebook.
#
# Note: we use Chrome, as there's a known issue with Safari that won't let Jupyter Notebook connect to a remote kernel.
